# HWUD-sem2-webproject


A website that archives, and allows you to view educational videos, tutorials and documentaries. Our website's goal is to highlight videos that we think you would find interesting, which would provide the user with a more varied and deeper understanding of a vast variety of topics.



The website has 4 main pages-

  -the homepage
  -the about us page
  -the contact us page
  -the database page



The Homepage is made to allow the user to navigate to each of the different pages, and also tries to catch the viewers attention with its design
